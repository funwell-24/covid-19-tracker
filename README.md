## Features

- Time series analysis of cases and deaths
- Vaccination progress tracking
- Country-wise comparisons
- Geographic visualizations
- Automated data updates
- Interactive plots

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries and time periods. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights generation using Python data tools.

## Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data from reliable sources
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Generate and communicate data insights
