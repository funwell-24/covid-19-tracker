# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).  
It explores cases, deaths, and vaccinations across selected countries and globally.  

Learners cleaned and processed the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), created visualizations, and summarized key insights.  
The project ends with an executive summary report suitable for presentation or publishing.



##  Project Objectives
- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data  
- ✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)  
- ✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions  
- ✅ Visualize trends with charts and interactive maps  
- ✅ Communicate findings with narrative insights
